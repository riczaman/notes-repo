##Find Action Items for the Last 2 Weeks in Outlook

```
Review my Outlook emails from the past 14 days (including Inbox and Sent Items).
Identify all work items, action items, deliverables, follow-ups, approvals, or tasks that require my attention — including:

Emails directly addressed to me (To: field)
Emails where I am CC’d in threads with fewer than 10 participants
Threads where I am asked to review, approve, provide input, submit documents, complete tasks, or follow up

For each identified work item:
Clearly summarize the task in one sentence.
Identify the requester.
Extract and highlight any mentioned deadlines, due dates, meetings, or key dates.
Note whether the deadline is explicit or implied.
Indicate whether the item appears completed (based on my reply) or still pending.

Then:
Remove duplicate tasks from long threads.
Group related items together.
Flag any overdue items.
Flag any items due within the next 7 days.
Finally, prioritize all pending items from highest to lowest priority using the following logic:

Urgent deadline (within 3 days or overdue)
High business impact or blocking others
Requested by leadership or multiple stakeholders
Medium priority (due within 1–2 weeks)
Low priority (no deadline or informational follow-up)

Present the final output in this format:

1. High Priority

Task:

Requested by:

Deadline:

Status:

Context:

2. Medium Priority
(same format)

3. Low Priority
(same format)

At the end, provide:

A short executive summary (3–5 bullets)

A recommended “Top 5 Things to Do Today”

```
