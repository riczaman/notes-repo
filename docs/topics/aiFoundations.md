##AI Foundations

- ==**Artificial General Intelligence**==: Is machines being able to replicate human intelligence capabilities like motor skills, learning, and intelligence. 
- When you apply AGI to specific and narrow objectives then you get ==**Artificial Intelligence**==

- 2 major reasons why we need AI:
   - `Automation & Decision Making`
   - `Creative Support` 

- Commonly Used AI Domains:

   1. Language: `Text-related AI tasks` use text as the input. `Generative AI tasks` the output text is generated by a model (ChatGPT). 
      - ==**Text as Data**==: Inherently Sequential = Sentences, multiple words = tokenization, varying sentence legnths = padding, and similair words = dot or cosine similarity and embedding.
      - `Language AI Models` = designed to understand, process, and generate natural language. (NLP)
      - Deep Learning Models that are used for NLP are: ==**Recurrent Neural Networks**== which process data sequentiall and stores hidden state, ==**Long Short-Term Memory**== which process data sequentially and can retain the context betther through use of gates, and ==**Transformers**== which process data in parallel by using concepts of self attention to better understand the context. 

   2. Audio & Speech: Can be either `Audio-Related` or `Generative AI`. 
      - ==**Audio & Speech as Data**==: Digitized snapshots in time like a sample rate, sampling rate of 44.1kHz, bit depth is the number of bits in each 44.1kHz of data. 
      - `Audio & Speech AI Models` = designed to process and manipulate audio and speech. 
      - Deep Learning models are: ==**Recurrent Neural Networks**, ==**Long Short-Term Memory**==, and ==**Transformers**==, ==**Variational Autoencoders**==, ==**Waveform Models**==, & ==**Siamese Networks**==

   3. Vision: Can be `Image Related` or `Generative AI`. 
      - ==**Image as Data**==: Images consist of pixels which can be grey scale or colour. 
      - `Vision AI models` = designed to process and understand visual information from images and videos
      - Deep Learning Models: ==**Convolutional Neural Networks**== which detect patterns in images, learning hierarchial representations of visual features and ==**YOLO**== which process the image and detects objects within the image, and ==**Generative Adversarial Network**== which generates real-looking images. 

###OCI AI Services
1. `Vision AI Services` allows us to do the following:
   - `Image Classification`: Upload an image which gets analyzed and labelled with confidence scores. 
   - `Object Detection`: Upload the image and then it detects objects with confidence scores.
   - `Text Detection`: upload an image and it extracts all the text from the image. 
   - `Document AI`: Upload a document and then it gives you the raw text and then assigns key value pairs and it extracts tables. 

2. `Language AI Services`:
   - `Text Analytics`: Analyzes a block of text and provides us language detection, text classfication, extracts entities, key phrase extractions and sentiment analysis. Also personal identifiable information
   - `Text Translation`: Translates text from one language to another. 

###AI vs ML vs DL
- Machine Learning Types:
   - `Supervised`: Extracting rules from labelled data. For example: Like credit card applications that use a rules engine. `Learning from labelled data`. 
   - `Unsupervised`: Extracting trends from unlabelled data. Grouping similair data into clusters like retail marketing and sales.
   - `Reinforcement`: Solving tasks by trial and error. 

- Deep Learning is used extracting features and rules from data and it uses neural networks with multiple layers.

##Machine Learning Foundations

- ML provides statidstical tools to analyze, visualize, and make predictions from data like Netflix movie suggestions. 

- ML uses `input features` to describe what the `output label` should be. Train the model with the input features and then when the model is trained we can apply ==**inference**== which is the ability to predic the label. 

- Types of Machine Learning:
   - Supervised which uses labeled data, unsupervised where we just understand relationships and reinforcement which make decisions. 
   - Supervised examples include: disease detection, weather forecasting, stock price prediction, spam detection
   - Unsupervised examples: Fradulent transactions, outlier detection and targeted marketing campaigns 
   - Reinforcement: automated robots, autonomous cars, healthcare and video games

##==**Supervised Learning: Classification**==
- There are 2 types of output labels:
   - `Continous` - This leads to `Regression`
   - `Categorical` - This leads to `Classification` and these can be `binary` or `multi-class` (different types of the same thing like 3 different species of a flower)

- Classification = a supervised mL technique used to categorize or assign data points into predefined classes based on their features or attributes. 
- They train using a labelled data set

Machine Learning Algorithm for classfication is: ==**Logistic Regression**==: helps in predicting if something is true or false. Logistic regression uses an S-sjaped curve (sigmoid) for the data as opposed to linear regression.

##==**Supervised Learning: Regression**==
- Independent features are the labeled input and the dependent feature is the output label
- Uses linear regression 
- loss is a number indicating how far the predicted value is from the actual value

##Jupyter Notebooks
- `Anaconda` is an open source python and R for data science and machine learning. It helps with package management and deployment. Within Anaconda is `Jupyter Notebooks` which is an IDE that allows you to share documents. 
- This opens up a terminal view on localhost of your files. 

- Machine Level Process consists of: 
   1. Loading Data
   2. Preprocessing - this involves creating features and labels
   3. Training a Model
   4. Evaluating the Model
   5. Making Predictions 

- Important ML Libraries in Python from `Sklearn`
   1. `train_test_split` - this module is used to split the data into 2 sets one where you can train the model and other set to test
   2. `StandardScalar` - Process of transforming data so it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 and it make sures all features use the same scale. if. square foot vs number of beds when predicting the price of a house. 
   3. `accuracy_score`- gives you an prediction of how strong the prediction is (classification)

- `Unsupervised Learning`:
   - There are no labelled outputs 
   - Algorithms learn the patterns in the data and group similair data items together. 

   - ==**Clustering**==: is the grouping of simialir data items
   - ==**Similarity**==: is how close two data points are to each other and is a value between 0 and 1 and this determines what cluster objects belong too.

   - Unsupervised Workflow:
      1. Prepare the data (remove missing values and normalize)
      2. Create similarity metrics
      3. Run the clustering algorithm (parition, density, hierarchial and distribution)
      4. Interpret results and adjust clusternig 

- `Reinforcement Learning`:
   - type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn from its interactions within the enviornment.
   - agent = interacts with the enviornment and takes action and learns from feedback
   - enviornment = external systems with which the agent interacts
   - state = representation of the current situation of the enviornment
   - action = possible moves or decisions that the agent can take
   - policy = mapping that the agent uses to devide which action to take

   - `optimal policy` = finding the policy that yields a lot of rewards. The algorithms used are: ==**Q learning or Deep Q learning**==

##Deep Learning Foundations
- A subset of machine learning that focuses on training ==**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**== with multiple layers 

- ML needs us to specify features wheres in `Deep Learning extracts features from raw and complex data and DL algorithms allow parallel processing of data so it has better scalability and performance`. 
- The use of GPUs were needed for this complex learning and machine algorithms

- Types of Deep Learning algorithms can be broken down into two types: `Data` (Images, videos, text, audio) and the `applications` (image classification, face detection, NLP) 

1. Deep Learning Alorithm for `images` is ==**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**==

2. For `text` we use ==**Transformers, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**==

3. For `images, audio and text generation` we can use: ==**Transformers, Difussion models, and Generative Adversarial networks (GAN)**==

- Building Blocks of ANN:
   1. `Layers` which are inputs and hidden layers 
   2. `Neurons` are computantional units that accept input and produce an output and applies ther activation function to generate output
   3. `Weights` which determine the strength of connection between neurons
   4. `Activation Function` work on the weighted sum of inputs to a neuron to produce an output
   5. `Bias`: is additional input to a neuron that allows a certain degree of flexibility 

- ANNs are trained using ==**Backpropgation Algorithm**== which is guessing and comparing and then measuring the error. Then the weights are adjusted and then weights are updated. Repeat and Learng Model training method

- Deep Learning Models for `Sequence Models`
   - Sequence models are input data in the form of sequences and the goal is to find patterns and make predictions. Like NLP, speech recognition, gesture recognition, etc

   -==**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**== handle sequential data and there is a feedback loop and it can maintain a hidden state or memory and it updates as each element in the sequence is processed. So it can capture dependencies 
      -Architecture:
         1. `One to One`: used for non sequential data
         2. `One to Many`: music generation or sequence generation
         3. `Many to one`: sentiment analysis 
         4. `Many to Many`: machine translation and entity recognition. 
    
    -==**Long Short Term Memory**==: Works by using a specialized memory cell and gating mechanisms to capture long term dependencies which RNN is not good at. 
    - Input processing at step 1, then it recieves the previous memory hidden state value then there is a gating mechanism (input gate, forget gate, and output gate) then it updates the memory and then it produced output generation. 

    -==**Convolutional Neural Networks**==: 
       -Deep Learning Models: 
           1. `Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN)` - multi layer perception MLP (simplest)
           2. `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)` - good for image and video 
           3. `Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)` - good  for time series and sequential data
           4. `Autoencoders` - are unsupervised learning models used for feature extraction.
           5. `Long Short Term Memory` - specilized RNN for long term dependencies
           6. Generative Adversarial Network` (GAN) producing images and content 
           7. `Transformers` which is used for language processing 

        - CNN: processes grid like data like images and videos. CNN works good with 2D data by reducing images into an easier to process form. 

        - CNN Layers:
           1. Input Layer 
           2. Feature Extraction layers: This layer is to automatically learn and extract patterns from the input images
              -convolutional layers (uses small filters kernels)
              -activation function allows the network to learn more complex non linear data
              -pooling layer reduces computational complexity
              -fully connected layer
              -softmax layer
              -dropout layer
           3. Classification Layers

        - Limitations of CNN:
           - Computation: needs alot of data and compute 
           - Overfitting: happens with limited traning data
           -Interpretiability: black box models
           -Sensitivity: sensitive to input variations 

        - Main use of CNN is image classification, object detection, image segmentation, face recognition.

##Generative AI & LLM Foundations

###Intro to GenAI
- Subset of Deep learning where the models are trained to generate output on their own.
- GenAI models learn the underlying patterns in a given data set and uses that knowledge to create a new data set. 

-ML identifies patterns to recognize and classify patterns.
-`inference` is the ability to predict based on the training that was done before. 
-ML focuses on learning the relationship between data and the label
-In GenAI it learns patterns in an unstructured content and it doesn't need labelled data to train. 
-The output of ML is a label whereas in GenAI it is New content. 

- 2 types of Gen AI Models
   1. `Text-Based`: models generate text, code, dialogue and they learn from large collections of text data
   2. `Multimodal`: process multiple modalities like text, images, videos, etc. 

###Intro to LLM
- A language model (LM) is a probalistic model of text. 
- it helps determine what the next word will be in a sentence it gives a probabilitity to every word in its vocab. 
- Large in LLM stands for the nuumber of parameters.
-`EOS` stands for end of sentence or end of sequence. 

LLM Features:
   - Based on ==**Transformers**== this allows them to play attention to specific parts and gives them enhanced contextual understanding. 
   - Deep Neural networks that are trained on a large set of text
   - Paremeters are adustable weights in the models neural network. 
   - Model size is the memory required to store the models parameters

==**Transformers**==
- `Recurrent Neural Network` handle sequential data like a sentence and they have a feedback loop that allows them to store and maintain a hidden state but RNN has trouble with `Long-range dependencies`. 
   - As the length of the sentence grows it leads to `Vanishing Gradient` which means it loses context of the entire sequence. 

- Transformers Architecture: 
   - They understand the relationship between all the words in a sentence at the same time and understand how they relate to each other. 
   - ==**Attention Mechanism (Self Attention)**== is used by transformers that adds context to the text and this also helps with long range dependencies 

- Transformer has 2 main parts:
   1. ==**Encoder**==: reads the input text aand encodes it into meanings using attention mechanism. Used for semantic search. 
   2. ==**Decoder**== uses these embeddings to generate the output text of the next word (token). Decoders only generate a single token at a time. Used for text generation.
- `tokens`: LLM understand tokens instead of workds. Tokens can be a part of a word, an entire word or a punctuation

- `Embeddings`: numerical representation of a piece of text converted to number sequences. They can also be used in semantic search in a vector database

- Words get converted into tokens then into embeddings (vector data)

- `Encoder-Decoder`: encoder encodes a sequence of words to a set of vectors and the decoder generates the output sequence from the set of vectors. Here the decoder has a self referential loop as it keeps generating all of the tokens in the sequence. `Used for machine translation`

###Prompt Engineering
- ==**Prompt**==: the input or the initial text provided to the model 
- ==**Prompt Engineering**==: the process of iteratively refining a prompt for the purpose of eliciting a particular style of a response. 
-  `instruction tuning` is a critical step in LLM alignment and it involves fine tuning a pre trained LLM on a varied set of instructions, each paired iwth a desired output.
   - ==**Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback**== is used to fine tune LLMs to follow a broad class of written instructions. 

- `In-context Learning`: prompting an LLM with instructions and or demonstrations of the task it is meant to complete
- `k-shot prompting`: explicitly providing k examples of the intended task in the prompt 

- `Chain of Thought Prompting`: provide examples in a prompt to show responses that include a reasoning step and describes the calculation logic to get to the final answer before giving the final answer. 

- `Hallucination`: model generated text that is non factual and ungrounded. 
   -`retrieval-augmentation` have less hallucination then 0-shot prompting. 

###Customizing LLMs with your Data
   1. `Prompt engineering` is the easiest to start
   2. If you need more context than use `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)`
   3. More instructions require `Fine-tuning`
   - Usually need to use all of them

- ==**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**==: languge queries enterprise knowledge bases (databases, wikis, vector database) to provide grounded responses. RAG does not require fine-tuning 
   - Augmented Generation = providing a more concrete answer using the acquired information. 

- ==**LLM Fine-tuning & Inference**==: take pre-trained foundational model and provide additional training using custom data
   -`inference`: model recieves new text as input and generates output based on what it learning during pre-training and fine tuning. 
   -benefits: model performance on specific tasks, and improve model efficiency 

- Generative AI creates new content without making predictions
- Sequence models are indeed well-suited for tasks involving sequentially ordered data points or events, such as time series analysis, natural language processing, speech recognition, and language translation. However, for image classification and object recognition, traditional machine learning models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are more commonly used.
