*The AI stack consists of: Generative AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence*

- ==**Artificial Intelligence**==: Programming machines to imitate human intelligence

- ==**Machine Learning**==: Subset of AI where alogorithms are used to learn from past data and predict outcomes on new data or identify trends

- ==**Deep Learning**==: A subset of machine learning where algorithms are modelled to learn from complex data using neural networks.

- ==**Generative AI**==: A type of AI that creates new content

##AI Foundations

- ==**Artificial General Intelligence**==: Is machines being able to replicate human intelligence capabilities like motor skills, learning, and intelligence. 
- When you apply AGI to specific and narrow objectives then you get ==**Artificial Intelligence**==

- 2 major reasons why we need AI:
   - `Automation & Decision Making`
   - `Creative Support` 

- Commonly Used AI Domains:

   1. Language: `Text-related AI tasks` use text as the input. `Generative AI tasks` the output text is generated by a model (ChatGPT). 
      - ==**Text as Data**==: Inherently Sequential = Sentences, multiple words = tokenization, varying sentence legnths = padding, and similair words = dot or cosine similarity and embedding.
      - `Language AI Models` = designed to understand, process, and generate natural language. (NLP)
      - Deep Learning Models that are used for NLP are: ==**Recurrent Neural Networks**== which process data sequentiall and stores hidden state, ==**Long Short-Term Memory**== which process data sequentially and can retain the context betther through use of gates, and ==**Transformers**== which process data in parallel by using concepts of self attention to better understand the context. 

   2. Audio & Speech: Can be either `Audio-Related` or `Generative AI`. 
      - ==**Audio & Speech as Data**==: Digitized snapshots in time like a sample rate, sampling rate of 44.1kHz, bit depth is the number of bits in each 44.1kHz of data. 
      - `Audio & Speech AI Models` = designed to process and manipulate audio and speech. 
      - Deep Learning models are: ==**Recurrent Neural Networks**, ==**Long Short-Term Memory**==, and ==**Transformers**==, ==**Variational Autoencoders**==, ==**Waveform Models**==, & ==**Siamese Networks**==

   3. Vision: Can be `Image Related` or `Generative AI`. 
      - ==**Image as Data**==: Images consist of pixels which can be grey scale or colour. 
      - `Vision AI models` = designed to process and understand visual information from images and videos
      - Deep Learning Models: ==**Convolutional Neural Networks**== which detect patterns in images, learning hierarchial representations of visual features and ==**YOLO**== which process the image and detects objects within the image, and ==**Generative Adversarial Network**== which generates real-looking images. 

###OCI AI Services
1. `Vision AI Services` allows us to do the following:
   - `Image Classification`: Upload an image which gets analyzed and labelled with confidence scores. 
   - `Object Detection`: Upload the image and then it detects objects with confidence scores.
   - `Text Detection`: upload an image and it extracts all the text from the image. 
   - `Document AI`: Upload a document and then it gives you the raw text and then assigns key value pairs and it extracts tables. 

2. `Language AI Services`:
   - `Text Analytics`: Analyzes a block of text and provides us language detection, text classfication, extracts entities, key phrase extractions and sentiment analysis. Also personal identifiable information
   - `Text Translation`: Translates text from one language to another. 

###AI vs ML vs DL
- Machine Learning Types:
   - `Supervised`: Extracting rules from labelled data. For example: Like credit card applications that use a rules engine. `Learning from labelled data`. 
   - `Unsupervised`: Extracting trends from unlabelled data. Grouping similair data into clusters like retail marketing and sales.
   - `Reinforcement`: Solving tasks by trial and error. 

- Deep Learning is used extracting features and rules from data and it uses neural networks with multiple layers.
